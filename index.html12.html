<h1 style=color:aquamarine>Geography</h1>
<p>Located in the centre of Kazakhstan, the territory of Nur-Sultan exceeds 722 square kilometres with a population of more than one million. The city consists of three districts – former capital Almaty, Saryaka and Yessil. Situated in the dry steppe zone, which is a sub-zone of dry grass steppes, Nur-Sultan’s climate is sharply continental with cold and long winters and hot, moderately arid summers. Its convenient location in the centre of the Eurasian continent makes Nur-Sultan an economically advantageous transport, communication and logistics centre, described as a “transit bridge” between Europe and Asia</p>
